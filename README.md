### About this project 
I am making this engine just for learning computer graphic stuffs, and it is not a serious engine program. 

### Features include
 1. 3D model loading (.fbx)
 2. 3D game engine like gui (by using ImGui)
 3. Phong Shading Model
 4. 3D Gizmos (translation)
 5. Outline for picking objects (by using [jump flood algorithm](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tants/jfa.html))
 6. Shadow (Directional light)
 7. Load and apply texture to a game object
 8. Physically Based Rendering (PBR)

### Libraries
 1. C++17
 2. OpenGL 3.3
 3. [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
 4. [stb library](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
